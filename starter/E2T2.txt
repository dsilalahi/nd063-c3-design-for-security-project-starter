Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.

Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.

1. UDP ports are reachable from the internet; these should be blocked by the security groups
2. TCP ports other than port 80 should be blocked by the security groups
3. S3 buckets should have server-side encryption enabled and require SSL connection
4. Security groups should NOT allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0
5. The default security group of a VPC does not allow inbound/outbound traffic
